	MissionData:
		Briefing: The source of the ant's activity has been pinpointed in this area. We suspect that their nests are in this area -- they must be destroyed  \n\n A team of civilian specialists are en-route to your location. Use them to gas all the ant nests in the area. In addition, destroy all ants that you encounter.  \n\nBe careful -- these things can chew through anything. Good luck.
