		Briefing: We've lost contact with one of our outposts. Before it went off-line, we recieved a brief communique about giant ants. We're unsure what to make of this report, so we want you to investigate.  Scout the area, bring the outpost back on-line, and report your findings. If there is a threat, reinforcements will be sent in to help you.  Keep the base functional and radio contact open -- we don't want to lose the outpost again.
