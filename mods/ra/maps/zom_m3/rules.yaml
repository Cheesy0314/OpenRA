	MissionData:
		Briefing: Commander, the news from the front is disturbing. The enemy faction is in disarray and this disease seems to be the cause.\n\nReports from Edge Island seem to indicate an incident at a Bio-Research facility which led to the outbreak. The situation grows worse, our lead science team was attacked by enemy forces; we lost contact with them hours ago.\n\nYour mission is simple, find the rescue team and bring back survivors. If none exist then retrieve any notes they left behind.\n\nWatch yourself Commander, we believe the infection is spreading thru contact with the diseased...\n\nGoodluck.
